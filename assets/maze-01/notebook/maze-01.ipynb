    "# Mazes -- Part I.: Background\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This post provides a definition of mazes and proposes a high level approach to create them. This approach will then be utilised to create two maze images.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first define what the _desideratum_ is. We would like to _have_ maze images akin to those in Figure 1. There is a rather short sequence of actions to achieve it: print this page off. Then we have one. The issues arise if we wish to posses images that are slightly different in colour, shape, style. Neither of which is changable _via_ the said method.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal thus needs rewording. We wish to have maze images of specification of our choice. Alas, there is no method to obtain the desired images as trivial as the the previous one. The only way out seemingly is to create our own utility that produces maze images. Let us restate the goal once more. More importantly, even before starting, we should justify why we choose a certain set of actions, and the effort completing it. It is of paramount importance to recognise that discourse is now about actions not objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task statement\n",
    "1. Deliverable: program that creates maze images to given specification\n",
    "1. How to achieve it? Write one.\n",
    "2. Justification\n",
    "    * we would like to have a variety of maze images (sufficient, isn't it?)\n",
    "    * the components of the program can be reused in other utilities\n",
    "    * there are no available resources (or they are not flexible enough, incompatible with our tech stack)\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Maze definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The right level of abstraction helps writing reusable code or, even better, utilise units of code that have already been created. _right_ is just as enlightening word as _have_ was. In other terms, it is not especially helpful. By the term _right level of abstraction_ it is meant that the code is applicable to more than just a specific problem, data structure etc. The implementation, on the other hand, is not left blank.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to abstract a problem is to identify the common elements across its various instances. The first observation that both panels of Figure 1. contains regions from which it is possible to move to one or more neighbouring one. These regions are either squares (left panel) or pixels or polygons (right panel). There are too neighbouring regions to which it is impossible step (black squares (left panel) and back lines(right panel)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Three statemets are made based on these observations that define what a maze is.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Let $\\mathcal{S}$ a nonempty set of objects. (pixels, regions, etc)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\mathcal{S} \\neq \\emptyset\n",
    "$$\n",
    "2. The neighbours of an element of $\\mathcal{S}$ is denoted by $\\mathcal{N}(s)$\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    ! s \\in \\mathcal{N} \\\\\n",
    "    \\mathcal{N}(s) \\subseteq \\mathcal{S}\\setminus \\{s\\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "What exactly makes an element a neighbour of an other is irrelevant at this stage. We just formalised the fact that some points are sorrounded by other points irrespective wheter it is possible to move to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The linked set of an element, $s$ is denoted by $\\mathcal{L}(s)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    ! s \\in \\mathcal{S} \\\\\n",
    "    \\mathcal{L}(s) \\subseteq \\mathcal{N}(s)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, it is not of our conerns which neighbours are linked. We only stated how these elements may exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "These three statements above define what a maze is. It is a collection elements and movement may be allowed between neighbouring elements. This definition is also remarkably useless as far as implementation goes. Idealy, a definition would hint at data structures or classes of algorithms that could guide the developer to create the actual piece of software component.\n",
    "\n",
    "With little effort, the definitions can be transformed in to a more conducive one.\n",
    "1. Collect all the pairs of elements that are neighbours.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\mathcal{N} = \\bigcup\\limits_{s \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\{(s, t): t \\in \\mathcal{N}(s) \\} \\subseteq \\mathcal{S} \\times \\mathcal{S}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $\\mathcal{S}$ is considered to be vertices then $\\mathcal{N}$ is the set of edges. $(\\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{N})$ is thus a graph on which the possible reachable pairs can be drawn. This graph will be termed as pre-maze.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Collect all edges that are links\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    \\mathcal{L} = \\bigcup\\limits_{s \\in \\mathcal{S}} \\{(s, t): t \\in \\mathcal{L}(s) \\}\n",
    "    \\subseteq \\mathcal{N} \\subseteq \\mathcal{S} \\times \\mathcal{S}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The set $\\mathcal(L)$ will be called links.\n",
    "\n",
    "A maze, $M$ is the triplet of vertices, all edges and links:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    M = (\\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{N}, \\mathcal{L}) \\, .\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Remarks\n",
    "* The $\\mathcal{W} = \\mathcal{N} \\setminus \\mathcal{L}$ is called the walls.\n",
    "* If we only concern ourselfs with traversing the maze the tuple $(\\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{L})$ contains sufficient information. The neighbours are retained for specific purposes, such as drawing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, we established that a maze can be represented by graphs. This enables us to use graph algorithms to create mazes. Yet it is abstract enough that we need not care about what the elements are.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Making mazes\n",
    "\n",
    "The creation of a maze image consists of the following actions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. get the specifications (and discuss it!)\n",
    "1. define the set of maze objects that would fulfill the specs to the greatest extent\n",
    "1. define the pre-maze keeping the specs in mind\n",
    "1. apply an algorithm that creates the links\n",
    "1. visualise the maze\n",
    "\n",
    "My very limited experice confirms that (4.) takes the least amount of resources. Points (2.) and (3.) is where the bulk of the effort is spent. (5.) can sometimes be tedious and it is best to tackle it with experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Specifications\n",
    "\n",
    "Two properties of the mazes will be required\n",
    "1. there must exist a path between all pairs of vertices\n",
    "1. there must not be cycles of vertices\n",
    "\n",
    "These are more aesthetic requirements than anything else. The first one is to make sure that a line drawn on the maze will traverses its entire area. The second one is to ensure that always the shortest possible line is drawn between two vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Link generation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume that we finally have a pre-maze at hand. The specifications dictates us to invoke a graph algorithm that traverses the entire graph reaching each vertex only once. The options are plentiful:\n",
    "* breadth-first search: tends to create river system-like paths\n",
    "* depth-first search: tends to result in pine-like paths\n",
    "* your favourite (minimum) spanning tree algorithm, preferably Kruskal's algorithm to avoid elongated paths\n",
    "* loop-erased random walk.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Loop erased random walk\n",
    "\n",
    "We choose the loop erased random walk to create the linkage set. It is expensive due to the moves wasted in loops which are then deleted, but it produces the best looking graphs."

    "##### Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm in rather simple. Cyle free paths starting from vertices not in the maze are sequentially grown. Once the latest vertex in path is reaches maze the path is attached to it. This is repeated until all the vertices are in the maze. It is constructive to write out the alogrithm in more detail for it guides us implementing it.\n",
