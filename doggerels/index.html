<p><strong>Towards the Night Lights</strong><p />                                 

<p>
For a moment, I thought I would rest.<br />
Under darting rays my neck is bent.<br />
Behind my eyelids, scent of scorched roses<br />
closed in a garden that I have never<br />
stopped to see.
</p>

<p>
For a moment, I would rest. <br />
Let limp my palms. Numb of pressing <br />
against ever tightening corridors to open.<br />
Limbs are thirsty for the water that I<br />
dared not to drink.<br />
</p>

<p>
In a moment, I will rest.<br />
Freed of dust has been building over me.<br />
Mocking of sand won't be my lullaby,<br />
for the road still curves uphill<br />
under my feet. <br />
</p>

<p>
In this moment, I cannot rest.<br />
When my shadow has left me,<br />
beyond heat, beyond dust, <br />
even beyond steps, between the stars;<br />
with my eyes open.<br />
</p>

<p><strong>Mountain Weekend I.</strong><p />

<p>
The planned excitement. <br />
Peaks afresh all hours conquered.<br />
Trust'd discovery.<br />
</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Mountain Weekend II.</strong><p />

<p>
Counting contours, miles. <br />
Valley carries your legs up.<br />
Endless views unframed.<br />

<p><strong>A Zebra's Laments</strong><p />                                 

<p>
Call it pyjamas.<br />
Still, my nights are restless.<br />
My garment is a clutch of<br />
black and white fingers.<br />
Of the same hand that wove<br />
my flesh, and ushers<br />
red rivers in my limbs<br />
replenishing themselves.<br />
Still, I am but a meal<br />
for the maned beast.<br />
He savours indeed my stripes,<br />
and curves; beneath my form.<br />
I just hope he mistakes me<br />
for the flattest barcode.<br />
</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ice cream</strong><p />                                 

<p>
Queen rubbed her cheeks on my fingers.<br />
A memory that still lingers.<br />
A few coppers that remained loyal<br />
hidden in my pocket. Not royal.<br />
<p />

<p>
The early summer blowing dreams<br />
in my lungs and the skull in reams.<br />
I was strolling by the Harbourside,<br />
loosened or hastened the stride.<br />
<p />

<p>
For all I owned were my steps;<br />
friends convinced to follow ebb's<br />
devoted pilgrimage to the see.<br />
From my poor days, I tried to flee.<br />
<p />

<p>
They lead me by a corner shop<br />
In its cool premises once I hop.<br />
Glaring at the sweet and salt riches,<br />
the hungry hand an ice cream pinches.<br />
<p />

<p>
I possessed the cold treat not.<br />
It did me, though, untying the knot<br />
on my thoughts rigidly gripping.<br />
They escaped and I am traveling.<br />
<p />

<p>
Look at the blue wrap: it undulates.<br />
It is sea hugging boats with waves.<br />
Telling sailors' hopes and woes<br />
in wise words of quieted hues.<br />
<p />

<p>
Chatter of crests dampens, never rests.<br />
Walked from the port at thirst's behest<br />
Tempest I swirl from the darkest wine<br />
to quench it through the glass's spine.<br />
<p />

<p>
Blond beers yesterday, today grapes.<br />
Slow steps towards the waiting drapes.<br />
Creased in the afternoon. Tidied pillow.<br />
The tide tonight will billow.<br />
<p />

<p>
I wake to see frost on chocolate shell.<br />
Rocks of broken nuts to mountains swell.<br />
And I am now in a tight harness<br />
pulling myself over snowy ledges.<br />
<p />

<p>
I climb forward layer after layer<br />
where the air tastes cleaner.<br />
Deeper, still, there is a lure<br />
to continue this enchanting tour.<br />
<p />

<p>
Orange swirl white cream cleaves.<br />
Beak of toucan among silver leaves,<br />
who is playing hide and seek.<br />
Its mischievous eyes at you peek.<br />
<p />

<p>
Hoping to find him in the jungle;<br />
He will not make it any struggle.<br />
He lets me snuggle in tropical,<br />
where the colours are mystical.<br />
<p />

<p>
The birds are painting songs gaily<br />
in the humid, ancient-green canopy.<br />
Their sounds are dripping from the leaves<br />
collecting below in finest weaves.<br />
<p />

<p>
Streams merged from ripples of flavours<br />
emerge loudly that my tongue favours.<br />
As they overflow the grooves deepened,<br />
the ecstatic embrace is sweetened.<br />
<p />

<p>
I am breaking sweat not in labour<br />
but through joy which is major.<br />
Minor than minute ice cream is left.<br />
Still, my travels made me the richest.<br />
<p />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Evening Drinks</strong><p />                                 

<p>
I know the colours.<br />
Red, wine and white.<br />
The invitations.<br />
The truth seeps through <br />
the surface.<br /><p />


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Időjárás</strong><p />                                 

<p>
Bár ó méter, <br />
baró méter. <br />
Barométer? <br />
Barom éter! <br /><p />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hommage à A.H. </strong><p />                                 

<p>
Some carves blocks<br />
in to smooth shapes,<br />
mixes colours an other,<br />
one flows of notes<br />
guides to the ears. <br />
Eyes follow letters<br />
adjoined by else.<p/>

<p>
Yet, what an artist is<br />
who invents new words<br />
from his spine and <br />
composes epics on<br />
granite?<br /> 

Music it is,<br />
arranged of minute<br />
cracks. <br />
Ledges sung first<br />
or hundred times.<br />
A symphony of the free will.<br /><p/>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Wakhan days - The Journey</strong ><p />                                 

<p>The dusty drape of sunlight is <br />
pulleyed up by the morning. <br />
It seems unvexed in repeating. <br />
Smirks at the giggling dew as if <br />
it had overslept cuddling the grass. <br /> <p />

<p>The rocks yawn, unnumbered, <br />
they have seen many <br /> <p />

<p>steps, steps, steps... <br /><p />

<p> Once they were the mountain <br />
you have been climbing on end <br />
towards the further ones <br />
on paths stacking bends. <br /><p />

<p>The sun is now drawing <br /> 
its arc's dim length. <br />
Legs had been repeating <br />
an unchanged movemement <br />
are finally stretched. <br /> <p/>

<p> On the screen of eyelids<br />
you imagine the left forest. <br />
Yet, one heightens in yourself. <br />
For all the miles, dozens of them, <br />
has grown the strongest of trees <br /> 
rooting in the mind whose branches <br />
the calves have strengthened. <br />
You will wake not as a serf of the road,<br />
but the champion of the journey. <br /><p/>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Arbor peregrina </strong ><p />                                 

<p>Ochre breath of the desert rolls over,<br />
exhausted, dry as the sand once it carried<br />
and has scattered over thirsty shrubs,<br />
to encircle you with its last length of silk.<br /><p/>
 
<p>Musk of the dusk mingled with minute<br />
whiffs peeling off from bellies of fronds<br />
rises as you rinse in your scent of that<br />
dark, oily substance elongating leaves,<br />
stealing twigs to branches. <br /><p />

<p>History is<br />
being wrapped<br />
around your waist.<br /><p />

<p>Between enchanting grooves of bark<br />
dawn awakens and bathes you in<br />
salty mists of the calling seas.<br /><p />


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Seaside tanka</strong><p />

<p>Ocean gifts distance<br />
to rocks in humble murmurs.<br />
Grass whispering years.<br />
Settling sun's invitation <br />
where morning meets the waters. <p />


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Moments</strong></p>

<p>I open and close doors,<br />
in front of and behind me.<br />
Cigarettes.<br />
Slumbery steps to<br />
the mounted ashtray.<br />
The smoke escapes<br />
from my lungs.<br />
Only these creased<br />
mementos remain,<br />
building up and squeezed<br />
ill-fitting in the box.<br />
Caged moments.<br />
My throat is empty.<br />
Words are rolling back<br />
from the mouth,<br />
piling up.<br />
Once again<br />
I inhale.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p> 
<p><strong>Morning Swim</strong></p>
               
<p>Standing yet.<br />
The shore runs away from your feet,<br />
to home, under the duvet of blueness.<br />
Lay your chest against where water ends.<br />
Before dawn, with sky it comes to rest;<br />
seeking until their breath into one blends.<br />
Stride after stride relentless you push<br />
along the seam of separated hues.<br />
Undulating disquiet between blues.<br />
Your head bowing and raising anew midst<br />
slipping fingers of water fraying to mist.<br />
Empty fall they back, thirsty air still desist.<br />
Forgotten the coast, where they are bound,<br />
you keep swimming.<br /><p />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sorrow</strong></p>

<p>Black bird! Come, cover me with your feathers!<br />
Shadow me from the mischevous light.<br />
Dragging clouds thus not promise me the sun.<br />
Let your wings be my tent of sturdy canvas. <br />
When snow constructs empire on all that living;  <br />
exhale your warmth under my skin, like lovers'<br />
heartbeat through scented chest enchanted.<br />
Give me the comfort of half closed drawers, <br />
the invitation of shadows sitting behind doors,<br />
around a unlit candle burnt its bent history.<br />
Plug your plumag's grey wax into my ears.<br />
In your beak, to the tree from where hunters<br />
in their quieted follies are seen, take me.<br />
I will not sense cold, wait not for spring.<br />
I will be sat in silence as my feathers grow.<br /><p />

<p>&nbsp;</p>        
<p><strong>Sum</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> To J. M-W.</em> <p/>
<p>Loop of dust. <br />
On the ground. <br />
Around God's finger. <br /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Idling</strong></p>

<p>Along angled course <br />
let the flies dash around <br />
cutting the sluggish air <br />
in to pre-thought shards. <br /> </p>

<p>To discover the continent, <br />
that is my rugged cheeks, <br />
eager wings do not relent. <br />
Million flaps never cease. <br /> </p>

<p>Leaning against the wind <br />
they are sailing to my face. <br />
Head is rested on a plaid; <br />
above stretches a tree. <br /> </p>

<p>Branches yawning circles <br />
into their stacked shadow. <br />
Caring not 'tis the air rises <br />
or they are pushed below. <br /> </p>

<p>Flowing over sleepy fronds, <br /> 
listless light, lukewarm, <br />
in a careless, yielding nod,<br />
to drops it is gently torn. <br /> </p>

<p>I am not even watching. <br />
Letting rays fall upon my eyes. <br />
Some glancing, some sinking <br />
in the water that below lies. <br /> </p>

<p>Twin lakes, motionless they stay. <br />
Through once unknown shores  <br />
Ancient breeze is fading away. <br /> </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Chinguetti</strong></p>
 
<p>Ratchet of prayers 'cross the fence. <br />
Buzzing of flies upon my ears. <br />
Aimless wind rises to wash it all away <br /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Funafuti</strong></p>

<p>Any news from the island?<br /><br /></p>
<p>Numb limbs of sky resting,<br />far, they fold in the waters.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Speckles of ships on the horizon?<br /><br /></p>
<p>Molten glass trembles,<br />weighs upon the ocean.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Blares forgotten their horns?<br /><br /></p>
<p>Faded wind whimpers<br />between my fingers.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Have not I been drawing<br />lines in the sand?<br /><br /></p>
<p>Palm trees press their<br />shadows on the shore.<br /><br /></p>
<p>Any news from the island?<br /><br /></p>
<p>Be calm. The sea will<br />
rise and recede again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Figurine</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>To S.K.</em></p>
<p>Exhaled the heat,<br />
lungs are closed now<br />
in tightened metal chest.<br />
Off her skin,<br />
last layers of warmth that<br />
had never been hers<br />
peeled and forgotten.<br />
Shadow of the never finished<br />
movement surrounds her<br />
like fallen soldiers sleep.<br />
Still.<br />
Mellow sun trickles between<br />
her fingers poking towards it.<br />
By restless muscles<br />
arms are bending.<br />
And she raises her legs and<br />
dances, dances in the light!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Journey</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>To R.W.</em></p>
<p>You wonder<br />
the days,<br />
yester:<br />
jester and jitter<br />
of giggles.<br />
In whispers<br />
of sun,<br />
mellow marrow<br />
tomorrow<br />
yonder years<br />
you wander.<br /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Anniversary</strong></p>
<p>You have always been certain<br />
like the windows leak<br />
the warmth of a family,<br />
of children plodding&nbsp;<br />
with askew open arms<br />to embrace anyone<br />
during locked out<br />
winter nights...</p>

<p> You have always been sure <br />
that your light would<br />
attract someone <br />
in each second<br />
chewing away that chord<br />
you had bequeathed<br />
from the ancient pastures<br />
where ewes admire their<br />
penultimate stumbles. </p>

<p>Those glassy eyes,<br />
dripping, overflowing<br />
with yearn would<br />
yield to anyone, now,<br />
who bends over<br />
with the careless spine<br />
of a candle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Afternoon at St John's</strong></p>

<p>As if nothing has happened.<br />
The light bulbs flicker,<br />
Grains of sugar sink<br />
in the cup, bitter as ever.<br />
The waitress bends over<br />
behind the counter.<br />
Cars hooted as they passed.<br />
I have already paid.<br /><br /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Floating</strong></p>
<p>Rattle of blades has quieted.<br />
"Check canopy!" uttered one.<br />
Just whisper of low clouds.<br />
Light rolled on mushy lips.<br />
Rays pronounced slowly.</p>
