A handful of `python` generator exercises are presented in this post. The aim is to accumulate an inventory of simple manipulations upon which useful utilities can be constructed. These both consume and produce a single stream of elements.

## Note

The raw notebook is has been made accessible [here](https://github.com/bhornung11/bhornung11.github.io/blob/main/assets/py-gen-ex-01/py-gen-ex-01.py). The scripts are deposited in [this folder](https://github.com/bhornung11/python.generator.exercises/tree/main).

## Introduction

### Generators

What `python` generators are can be discussed until the cows come home. For the purposes of these notes, the generator is a function that calves as an iterator which
* yields an single element at a time
* on demand
* the iteration over which can be paused
* and resumed
* by maintaining a state

### Coding style

The `itertools` standard library equips `python` with utilities by means of which it is possible to implement a large proportion the transformation patterns discussed herein more efficiently. In fact, we will be creating inefficient `C` code for the most part below.

Docstrings shown here are constrained to show a short summary of the functions causing a considerable discomfort of the scribbler of these lines. This is in order to render the script entries a tad more terse to read.

The iterable inputs of the functions are always `iterators`. These can created by the `iter` function applied to any iterable object. For the greater part, it is fairly inconsequential whether an `iterable` of any sorts, such as lists, strings or generators are the inputs to our functions. 

## Basic generators

These generators perform simple tasks. Most of them are also available as either built-ins or in the `itertools` library. They reimplemented here as they provide a gradual introduction to more complex patterns.

### Identity

The identity generator is added for the sake of completeness. The elements of the original iterator are yielded unchanged. Its factory is implemented in the `identity` function. Alternatively, a single line of `yield from generator` would suffice if the input is a `generator`.

```python
def identity(iterator: Iterator) -> Any:
    """
    Creates a generator that yields
    the elements of the consumed iterator
    """

    for element in iterator:
        yield element
```

The intricate behaviour of this utility is demonstrated below.


```python
string = "abcdefghjikl"

print("DIY:")
iden_string = identity(iter(string))
print("\t", " ".join(next(iden_string) for i in range(6)))


print("\nbuiltin:")
iden_string = (char for char in string)  # this is a generator
print("\t", " ".join(next(iden_string) for i in range(6)))
```

    DIY:
    	 a b c d e f
    
    builtin:
    	 a b c d e f


### Repeating

An element is repeated multiple times in the generator returned by the `repeater` function.

```python
def repeater(iterator: Iterator, n: int):
    """
    Creates a generator that repeats each element of the original
    iterator at specified times.
    """

    for element in iterator:
        for i in range(n):
            yield element
```

Like so:


```python
print("DIY:")
repeat_string = repeater(iter(string), 3)
print("\t", " ".join(next(repeat_string) for i in range(6)))

print("\nbuiltin")
repeat_string = (char for char in iter(string) for i in range(3))
print("\t", " ".join(next(repeat_string) for i in range(6)))
```

    DIY:
    	 a a a b b b
    
    builtin
    	 a a a b b b


### Thinning

Every  n-th element is returned by the generator that is defined in the `thinner` function. Please note, that it maintains a state in addition to that of the `iterator` upon which it acts. This state is the actual value of the variables enclosed in its scope. In our case, that is `i`, the call counter.

```python
def thinner(iterator: Iterator, n: int) -> Any:
    """
    Creates a generator that selects every n-th element
    of the original iterator.
    """

    i = 0

    for el in iterator:
        if i % n == 0:
            yield el
        i += 1
```

In action:


```python
print("DIY:")
thin_string = thinner(iter(string), 2)
print("\t", " ".join(next(thin_string) for i in range(3)))

print("\nitertools:")
thin_string = compress(iter(string), (i % 2 == 0 for i in range(5)))
print("\t", " ".join(next(thin_string) for i in range(3)))
```

    DIY:
    	 a c e
    
    itertools:
    	 a c e


The `make_thinner` function is the left inverse of the `make_repeater`:


```python
repeat_string = repeater(iter(string), 2)
thin_string = thinner(repeat_string, 2)
print(" ".join(thin_string))
```

    a b c d e f g h j i k l


### Filter

The `filter` function selects elements based on a condition. A toy implementation, `filtr` (TM) is provided below only for the sake of completeness.

```python
def filtr(iterator: Iterator, cond: Callable) -> Any:
    """
    Makes a filtering generator. Only those elements yielded
    at which the condition evaluates to true.

   Parameters:
        iterator: Iterator : iterator!

    Yields:
        element: Any : a filtered element
    """

    for element in iterator:
        if cond(element):
            yield element
```

It is instructed to select the first two vowels of the English alphabet in the example below.


```python
print("DIY:")
filt_string = filtr(iter(string), lambda x: x in set("ae"))
print("\t", " ".join(filt_string))

print("\nbuiltin:")
filt_string = filter(lambda x: x in set("ae"), iter(string))
print("\t", " ".join(filt_string))
```

    DIY:
    	 a e
    
    builtin:
    	 a e
